# jspsych-survey-text-req

A version of the jsPsych survey-text plugin, but with additional options/features:

* Allows you to specify any required questions (forced response)
* Allows optional default/placeholder text for text input fields
* Focuses the first text input field when the page loads, so that the participant can start typing immediately

See the markdown doc for details.

This plugin was made using a snapshot of the jsPsych master branch from around June 2017 (so between v5.0.3 and the current branch in August 2017). It may need further editing to work with other versions of jsPsych. 

You will need to change the file paths in the HTML file :)
